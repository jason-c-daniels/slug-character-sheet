#### Chapter 1: Character Creation

Each character is described any way the
player wants. Use words, numbers, pictures,
symbols — whatever. However, the Game Master 
should be able to understand it, so be
ready to translate obscure character concepts
before play begins. The GM can modify outrageous proposals, 
suggest appropriate changes, or ban the character from a 
particular adventure or campaign.

###### Examples

"__Grok__ is strong, very strong. He's never met
anyone stronger. He's not real bright, but
good with his fists and clubs and throwing
stones. He doesn't speak much."

"__Andarra__ is a wizard who knows how to
create an illusion of almost anything. She can
also teleport and sometimes read thoughts,
but has trouble with the latter. On a 3-18 scale,
her stats are Intelligence 17, Dexterity 10,
Strength 9, Constitution 11, Perception 13,
Will 15, Charm 12, Appearance 14."

"__François__ is dashing, handsome, athletic,
and highly skilled with his sword. He is suave
and polished in his manner, and is skilled at
witty repartee. He is very weak in the sciences,
though. He is proud, quick-tempered, and
extremely loyal to the king. He is fond of
brawling in bars, carousing with friends, and
wooing lovely ladies (not necessarily in that
order)."

"__Juanita Martinez__ is a detective who
investigates the occult. She has an unreliable
ability (40% chance) to detect psionic activity
up to 300 meters (330 yards). She is also capable of 
some slight telekinesis: she can move
objects of up to 1/2 pound (1/4 kg) very slowly - 6 inches 
(15 cm) per second. She is highly
skilled (i.e., better than 70% chance) at
Research, Pistol Use, Driving and Bamboozling her 
way into places she has no business.
She is moderately skilled at Swimming, Moving Quietly, 
Lockpicking, Mexican Cooking,
and Photography. She is knowledgeable about
New York, Occult Matters, Computer Use,
Obscure Religions and Cults, and Standard
Police Procedures. Juanita is attractive, can be
jealous, and is more curious than is safe at
times. She has a few friends in high places."

"__Captain Horatio Quest__ is a war hero,
decorated many times in the war against the
Shleeshlokk Empire. His piloting skills are
legendary. He's a crack shot with a blast rifle,
and has extensive experience with personal
combat in zero-G. His intellectual abilities
run more toward tactics and strategy than
formal learning. Although in his mid-fifties,
Quest is still handsome (due to the heroic
efforts of reconstructive surgeons) and physically fit."
