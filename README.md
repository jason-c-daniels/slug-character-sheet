# Slug Character Sheet

## About
This is a client side only single page application, for the (semi-)joke, single page, Table Top ROG called SLUG. It was created by Steffan O'Sullivan.

The layout is based on some typesetting I did for the game many years ago. However I couldn't reinstall QuarkXPress so I was unable to determine the fonts that I originally used. So I punted and grabbed some approximate fonts from the creative commons community.

The app features the basic things you would expect of a desktop app: new, load, save, print.
Since there is no "Name" field, the "saved" (downloaded) file will always be named the same. Be sure to rename it to something meaningful.
