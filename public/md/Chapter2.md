## Chapter 2: Action Resolution

When the GM asks a player to roll some
dice, the player should roll some dice. The GM
can specify the number, size, and shape of the
dice, or just let the player choose. The GM will
assess the result based on how far above or
below the average the result is - the higher, the
better (unless the GM says otherwise). The
GM rolls in secret on occasion, mostly for
information rolls.

### Examples:

__Player:__ "Andarra creates an illusion of a large,
angry dragon."

__GM:__ "Roll three six-sided dice."

_(Andarra's player rolls a 4 and two 5s.)_

__GM:__ _(comparing the roll to an average total of
10-11):_ "The bandits run in terror of the
dragon that appears beside Andarra!"

__Player:__ "Grok tries to put the pieces of the
radio back together."

__GM:__ "Okay, roll some dice." (Grok's player
rolls a 1 on a d4.) "The scattered pieces
confuse Grok so much, he gets a
headache."

__Player:__ "Does Fran√ßois recognize the lady's
accent?"

__GM:__ _(secretly rolling two 10-sided dice, getting
a 3 and a 5, and reading them as percentiles for a result of 35%):_ 
"You can't quite place it - definitely not Italian, though, 
and probably not Spanish."

### Modifiers:

The GM may assign a modifier to the Action Resolution Roll. 
A modifier may be of any appropriate amount, up or down, 
depending on the circumstances (and on the number and type 
of dice rolled). For example, a magic
sword may give a bonus in combat; scaling a
cliff is easier with proper climbing gear; and a
character described as a master of a skill gets
a bonus when using that skill. Conversely, a
wound might mean a penalty to most actions;
and fighting in poor conditions will probably
subtract something from a combat roll.
