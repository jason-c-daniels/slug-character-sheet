## Chapter 3: Character Development

As the game progresses, a character will
encounter situations that will test things that
weren't written down at first. The player should
explain to the GM how good the character is in
such a situation.

###Examples:

"Oh, yes, Grok's climbed lots of cliffs before,"

_or_

"François might recognize a Spanish or English accent with luck.
He would recognize an Italian accent easily, though - there 
are Italians in the Musketeers."

The GM will probably accept an explanation
if it seems in keeping with the original character concept. 
However, if it's not written down,
the GM doesn't have to accept an explanation,
and can decide how good the character really is.

With the GM's permission, such traits can be
added, or existing traits or skills improved, after
the gaming session. For example, François
might spend a week "negotiating" a non-existent deal with 
an English merchant just to have 
a better chance of recognizing an English 
accent in the future. It is doubtful, however, 
that Grok will ever get the radio to work again.
